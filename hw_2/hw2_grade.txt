Thanks for providing a README telling me where to look for things!

----------------------------------------
Problem 1: 5/5
----------------------------------------
1/1: plot with caption
4/4: analysis

I think it's actually a problem that one needs to consult the
caption for so much information. When analyzing the most important plot
of your own or any paper, consider not only the experience someone will
have when encountering this within the manuscript but also the experience 
so many people will have trying to use your game-changing plot in a talk. 
It sounds like the caption is really useful for the first case. And you
have addressed aesthetic issues (typesetting and colors) related to
the second. But for showing a story at a glance, it is really important to,
for instance, label the dashed line on the plot. Or have a legend to let
people *know* that the red curve is Lambda-CDM (and what the heck the 
green stuff is).

Problem 2: 4/7 
----------------------------------------
3/3: Recreated plot
2/3: New dynamic interactions
0/1: Analysis of changes
-1 export issues

Did you test this with a fresh kernel? You have a variable "length" used that
is undefined in the code, so I had to rewrite your code to run it. 
Well, it's defined in the cells that I was instructed to
ignore... so yeah, pretty confused. It only affects the color mapping I think?

I don't see any text explaining what you were trying to do or why (I see that you 
were trying to combine two panels but I don't know why or how the implementation
helps with illustrating a concept). 

Wouldn't it have been good to link the panels so that when I zoom in on one section
of parameter space in one panel I can compare between all three?

Problem 3: 5/5

5/5: Reproduced plot: title, twin_x, legend, limits, linestyles
