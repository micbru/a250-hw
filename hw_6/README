This homework tries to classify images using a random forest classifier from a test set of 50 different categories of images.

This is all done in hw6.ipynb. That file contains a summary at the top of what I did, what my most important features are, and my best success rate.

To run the final classifier as asked for in the homework, scroll to the bottom of hw6.ipynb, change the path to the desired path of new images, and run that cell. 
It reads in the features.txt and labels.txt I already got from feature extraction. I included these text files because the feature extraction is very slow, and I did not check the test set into git. That means the code will not work unless the "50_categories" folder is added to the same directory.

Thanks! I hope this all makes sense.
